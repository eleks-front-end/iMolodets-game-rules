                    The game has 32 cards, 16 of which are used when playing with 2 to 4 players. The other 16 are added to the game when playing
                    with 5 to 8 players. Each different card name represents someone at the IT company. Each card has a value
                    in the upper left corner — the higher the number, the closer that person is to the Customer. At the bottom
                    of each card, a text box describes the effect when the card is discarded.

                    iMolodets is played in a series of rounds. Each round represents one day. At the end of each round, one player’s proposal
                    reaches Customer, and he
                    <strong>considers</strong> it. When he get enough proposals from one
                    <strong>suitor</strong>, he gets invitation and grants that
                    <strong>suitor</strong> permission to start project. That player wins the game.
                </p>
                <p>Taking a turn </p>
                <p>On your turn, draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand. Then choose one of the two cards in
                    your hand and discard it face up in front of you. Apply any effect on the card you discarded. You must
                    apply its effect, even if it is bad for you. See next pages for the effects of each individual card.
                    Likewise, if you have any questions about special cases regarding the card, you’ll find the answer there.
                    All discarded cards remain in front of the player who discarded them. Overlap the cards so that it’s
                    clear in which order they were discarded. This helps players to figure out which cards other players
                    might be holding.</p>
                <p>Once you finish applying the card’s effect, the turn passes to the player on your left.
                </p>
                <p>Out of the round</p>
                <p>If a player is knocked out of the round, that player discards the card in his or her hand face up (do not
                    apply the card’s effect) and takes no more turns until next round.
                </p>
                <p>Honesty </p>
                <p>A player could cheat when chosen with the
                    <strong>Recruiter</strong>, or fail to discard the
                    <strong>Account Manager</strong> when that player has the
                    <strong>PM</strong> or
                    <strong>TeamLead</strong> in hand. We suggest that you don’t play with knaves who cheat at fun, light games.

                <p>End of a round</p>
                <p>A round ends if the deck is empty at the end of a turn. The IT company closes for the evening, the person
                    closest to the Customer delivers the proposal, and Customer retires to his office to read it. All players
                    still in the round reveal their hands. The player with the highest ranked person wins the round. In case
                    of a tie, the player who discarded the highest total value of cards wins.
                </p>
                <p>A round also ends if all players but one are out of the round, in which case the remaining player wins.
                </p>
                <p>After a round ends, the winner (or winners, if there was a tie at the end of the round) receives a Token
                    of victory. Shuffle all 16 cards together, and play a new round following all of the setup rules above.
                    The winner of the previous round goes first, because the Customer speaks kindly of him or her at lunch.</p>
                <p>Game End and How to Win (2 to 4 Players)</p>
                <p>A player wins the game after winning a number of Tokens of Affection based on the number of players:
                    </br>
                    2 Players 7 tokens </br>

                    If you are playing the game with 5 to 8 players, then assemble all 32 of the cards into a deck. Shuffle them to form a face-down
                    draw deck. Remove the top card of the deck from the game without looking at it and place it aside. Each
                    player draws 1 card from the deck. Play now proceeds as it would for a 2 to 4 player game. However, note
                    that in the 5-8 player game, when a card’s effect requires you to “Name a number”, that effect applies
                    to all cards with that number. For example, if you name “4” as a result of the Recruiter’s effect, then
                    it would affect both the QA and the HR, both of whom have a value of “4”.
                </p>
                <p>Game End and How to Win (5 to 8 Players)</p>
                <p>A player wins 5 to 8 player games after winning 4 Tokens of victory. Because some of the cards used in the
                    5-8 player version of the game make it possible to gain Tokens of victory in ways other than winning
                    a round, it’s entirely possible that a player could win the game without ever having actually won a round.
                    Such are business realities! It’s also possible that two (or more) players could “tie” in terms of winning
                    the game, again because of some of the cards used in the 5-8 player version of the game. For example,
                    say two players, Bob and Susan, remain in the game. Each has 3 Tokens of victory. In his discard pile,
                    Bob has Admin (If this card is in your discard pile when you are out of the round, gain an Victory Token.).
                    Susan plays a card that knocks Bob out of the round. This leaves Susan as the winner of the round, as
                    she’s the last remaining player, so she gains a Token of victory. However, Bob points to the Admin with
                    a smile when he’s eliminated, so he also gains a Token of Victory. Both players now have 4 Tokens of
                    Victory, so they “tie” for the win. Therefore, Bob and Susan now play another round to break the tie.

                        the Trainee (to all players), the Recruiter’s player is eliminated from the round, while you are
                        not. Of course, all other players will now know that you have the Trainee in your hand. It would
                        be both improper and dangerous to keep consorting with such an unsavory character, so after you’ve
                        resolved the Trainee’s effect, you must discard him and draw a new card. If the deck is empty and
                        you cannot draw a card, then draw the card that was removed at the start of the round.
