                        You do not need to reveal that you have Project Manager or Team Leader. Actually, you can discard
                        Account Manager even if you do not have those cards. Account Manager likes to play mind games...</p>

                        get a better hand. That&apos;s the end of your turn – don&apos;t play the effect of your new hand

                    <p>You can take away the power of any player&apos;s hand! The player who you choose (this can also be you)
                        must discard their hand without playing its effect. If all other players are out or protected by
                        the HR effect, you must choose yourself. The player who discarded their hand draws a new card. If
                        the deck is empty, draw the card that was put aside at the start of the round.

                    <p>Your superpower is immunity. When you discard the HR, you can ignore the effects of other player&apos;s
                        hands until the start of your next turn. E.g., you don’t need to discard your hand when another player
                        chooses you as a part of the Team Leader effect. If you and the Team Leader are the only players
                        left, then the Team Leader must discard their own card.</p>

                    <p>You have a chance to knock out your competitors! Choose another player and secretly compare hands. The
                        player with the lower number is knocked out of the round. In case of a tie (both hands have the same
                        number), nothing happens.</p>

                    <h3>2 – Information Developer</h3>
                    <p>InfoDevs dig up all kinds of information. When you discard the InfoDev, you can look at another player&apos;s
                        hand. You do not need to reveal it to anyone – keep it a secret and use it to your advantage. </p>

                    <p>When you discard the Recruiter, choose a player and name a number other than 1. If the player&apos;s
                        hand has that number, the player is knocked out of the round. However, there&apos;s a catch: if you
                        choose a Trainee, no matter what number you name (even 0), you are knocked out of the round.

                    <p>Choose a player and name a number other than 1. If the player&apos;s hand has that number, you get a
                        Token of Success. If you guess right, the player may discard their card without playing its effect
                        and draw a new card (with the exception of Customer). At the end of the round, when players compare
                        hand numbers, CEO loses to the Customer despite the impressive number 9.</p>

                        higher number is knocked out of the round. Yep, even though your number is lower, you are more important
                        to the team. In case of a tie, nothing happens.</p>

                    <h3>6 – System Administrator</h3>
                    <p>The Admin is a somewhat unusual card – its effect applies when you are knocked out of the round with
                        this card in your discard pile. Means your hardware is in order. Go ahead and claim a Token of Success!</p>

                    <h3>5 – DevOps Engineer</h3>
                    <p>This card is your secret advantage at the end of the round. When players compare hand numbers, DevOps
                        in your discard pile increases your hand number by 1. This stacks: if you have 2 DevOps in your discard
                        pile, increase your hand number by 2.

                    <p>This is a card with an effect like none other! When you discard the QA, name another player (or yourself).
                        If the next card that is played (e.g., Recruiter) has an effect to choose one or more players, then
                        the named player (or yourself) must be chosen during this effect. If all other players are out or
                        protected by the HR effect, you must choose yourself.</p>

                    <p>You get an insight into your team like no other player. When you discard the Designer, you can look at
                        the hands of 1 or 2 other players. Keep this information secret and use it to your advantage! </p>

                    <p>When you discard the BA, choose 2 players (you may include yourself), and they will switch hands. After
                        that, you can look at 1 of those hands without revealing it to other players. If less than 2 players
                        can be chosen (e.g., all other players are protected by the HR effect), simply discard this hand.</p>

                    <h3>0 – R&amp;D Engineer</h3>
                    <p>Prediction is definitely among your strong points! When you discard the R&amp;D Engineer, choose another
                        player – ideally, the one you believe is likely to win the round. Give the R&amp;D token to that
                        player, so that everyone remembers your choice. If the chosen player wins the round, you gain a Token
                        of Success.

                    <h3>0 – Trainee</h3>
                    <p>You are a real dark horse in the game! If another player chooses you when playing a Recruiter, no matter
                        what number that player names (even 0), the Recruiter’s player is knocked out of the round. Now,
                        all players know your hand, so discard it and draw a new card. If the deck is empty, draw the card
                        that was put aside at the start of the round.
